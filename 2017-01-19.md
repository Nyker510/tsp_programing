Application and efficient implementation of forced TSP program

route cost minimization
* america travel problem

$$
\min w(H) \\
{\rm s.t.}\ H{\rm\ travel\ edge\ }
$$

* select edges so as to make connected path.
    * if exist an edge has path over 2.

p: probability of an edge.

branch and bound algorithm is exact one.

start
1. choose edge 1 all tour
2. make branch tour has edge A and not has edge A.

## mirai
select the lowest edge  
p = 1, the dense graph.

* introduction of tsp program
* Application of TSP
* upper bound and lower bound
    * upper bound - min {cost of a tour we have known}
    * lower bound - already visited tour's cost
* possible solution algorithm
* experiment
